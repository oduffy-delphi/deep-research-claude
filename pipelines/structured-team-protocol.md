# Deep Research Structured Team Protocol (v2.1)

> Referenced by agent definitions and `structured.md` command.

## Overview

Agent Teams-based structured research: the EM reads a spec YAML, pre-processes it into a scout brief, creates a team of a Haiku scout + Sonnet verifiers + an Opus synthesizer, spawns all teammates, and is **freed**. The team handles everything autonomously — spec-driven source discovery, schema-mapped verification, adversarial cross-pollination between verifiers, cross-topic reconciliation, and schema-conforming output. The EM is notified when synthesis completes, validates schema conformance via a hard file-existence gate, then cleans up.

Pipeline C is spec-driven and schema-conforming. Unlike Pipeline A (free-form internet research), every finding maps to an output schema field, every verifier self-checks acceptance criteria and gate rules embedded in their prompts, verifiers actively challenge each other's schema field values, and the final output is validated against the spec before the team is torn down.

## Team Roles

| Role | Model | Count | Responsibility |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Scout** | Haiku | 1 | Execute spec-derived search queries from scout-brief.md, map findings to schema fields, write per-topic discovery files |
| **Verifier** | Sonnet | 1-5 | Verify scout's per-topic discovery, compare against existing data, produce schema field tables with change types (CONFIRMED/UPDATED/NEW/REFUTED/CONTESTED), self-check acceptance criteria and gate rules, challenge peers' field values |
| **Synthesizer** | Opus | 1 | Cross-topic reconciliation, resolve CONTESTED fields, schema validation, produce YAML/JSON output conforming to output_schema |

## Team Lifecycle

```
EM: Read spec → pre-process into scout-brief.md → Create team → Spawn all teammates → FREED
Scout: Read scout-brief.md → WebSearch → WebFetch (vet accessibility) → Map to schema fields → Write per-topic discovery files → Mark complete → [idle]
Verifiers: [blocked by scout] → Read discovery files → Verify + compare existing data → Challenge peers → Produce schema field tables → Self-check gate rules → Converge → Mark complete → DONE to synthesizer
Synthesizer: [blocked by verifiers, waiting for DONE msgs] → Verify all complete → Write skeleton to OUTPUT_PATH → Cross-reconcile → Resolve CONTESTED → Validate schema → Overwrite OUTPUT_PATH with final → Write annotations → Mark complete
```

## Blocking Chain

```
Scout (no blockers) ──────→ task completion unblocks verifiers
Verifiers (blockedBy: scout) ──→ DONE messages wake synthesizer
Synthesizer (blockedBy: all verifiers) ──→ mark complete notifies EM
```

- **Scout → Verifiers:** Task-gated via `blockedBy`. Verifiers unblock when scout marks its task complete. No messaging needed — verifiers haven't started yet (confirmed empirically 2026-03-21).
- **Verifiers → Synthesizer:** Task-gated via `blockedBy` + DONE messages as wake-up signals. The synthesizer is already running but idle — it needs explicit DONE messages to trigger its next poll cycle (confirmed empirically 2026-03-21).

### How Agent Teams Blocking Actually Works (empirical + sourced)

Agent Teams uses **file-based polling, not callbacks**. Task state is managed by the platform in `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/N.json` (platform-internal; do not read/write these files directly). Agents discover available work by calling `TaskList()`, which re-evaluates `blockedBy` arrays fresh on each call. There is no active push/callback when a blocker completes.

**Two distinct scenarios with different wake-up behavior:**

| Scenario | Agent State | Wake-Up Mechanism | Message Needed? |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Task-blocked (pending)** | Not yet started — `pending` status, waiting for blockers | `TaskList()` re-evaluates `blockedBy` on next poll; agent auto-starts when unblocked | No — auto-wake works |
| **Message-blocked (idle)** | Started, checked status, went idle waiting | Needs an inbox message to trigger the next poll cycle | Yes — explicit DONE message required |

The scout→verifier transition is scenario 1 (auto-wake). The verifier→synthesizer transition is scenario 2 (DONE messages needed). Both confirmed empirically 2026-03-21.

**Shutdown behavior:** Teammates prioritize completing their current work loop over acknowledging shutdown requests. Expect convergence protocol (CONVERGING → wait → write → mark complete → DONE) to run before shutdown acknowledgment. This is good for data integrity but means team teardown takes 30-60 seconds after shutdown requests are sent.

## Scout Protocol

The scout builds **per-topic discovery files** — schema-mapped findings, one file per topic. It does NOT try to produce finished analysis.

- Reads topic queries and schema field mappings from `{scratch-dir}/scout-brief.md` (written by EM during pre-processing)
- Executes queries via WebSearch, including adversarial queries when provided by the EM
- Mechanically vets each result via WebFetch: accessible? paywall? date? source type?
- Maps each finding to schema fields (as listed in scout-brief.md)
- Writes one discovery file per topic: `{scratch-dir}/{subject}-scout-{topic_id}.md`
- **No messaging** — scout has no SendMessage tool. Task completion is the only signal.
- **Timing:** No floor. Ceiling: 3 minutes. This is mechanical work — go fast.

## Message Protocol

### Verifier → Verifier (Adversarial Cross-Pollination)

Send targeted messages to specific peers by name. Challenges are **expected**, not just permitted — verifiers should actively test each other's schema field values.

| Category | Format | When |
|---|---|---|
| **FINDING** | `"Finding for {peer}: {brief}. Source: {URL}. Schema field: {field_name}. Relevant because {reason}."` | A discovery relevant to another verifier's schema fields |
| **CONTRADICTION** | `"Contradiction with {peer}: I found {X} for field {field_name} but your area suggests {Y}. Can you verify?"` | Sources disagree on a schema field value across topics |
| **CHALLENGE** | `"Challenge to {peer}: Your finding {X} for field {field_name} conflicts with {Y} from {source}. Which is current?"` | Direct factual conflict on a schema field value — resolution expected |
| **SOURCE** | `"Source for {peer}: {URL} — covers {aspect} relevant to your topic / field {field_name}."` | Useful source for a peer's topic or schema field |
| **SCHEMA_OVERLAP** | `"Schema overlap with {peer}: While researching {my_field}, I found evidence relevant to your field {their_field}: {value} from {source}. Flagging for your verification."` | Evidence found for a schema field owned by a different verifier |

**Resolution protocol:** When a peer challenges a schema field value, the challenged verifier must respond with evidence or concede. Unresolved challenges (2-minute timeout) produce `CONTESTED` change type with both sides' evidence — the synthesizer resolves these.

### Verifier → Synthesizer (Wake-Up Signal)

`blockedBy` is a status gate, not an event trigger — completing a blocker task does NOT automatically wake the blocked teammate. Verifiers must explicitly message the synthesizer after completing their task:

| Category | Format | When |
|---|---|---|
| **DONE** | `"DONE: {topic_id} findings written to {scratch-dir}/{topic_id}-findings.md"` | After marking own task `completed` |

This is the synthesizer's wake-up mechanism. Each DONE message causes the synthesizer to re-check `TaskList`. When all verifier tasks show `completed`, it proceeds with synthesis.

### Volume Governance

- **Peer messages: max 3 per peer** (max 12 total for a 5-verifier team)
- **DONE message: exactly 1 per verifier** (sent to synthesizer only)
- **Scout: no messages** (task completion handles unblocking)
- Quality over quantity — **no acknowledgment-only messages** ("got it", "thanks", "acknowledged"). Every message must contain a finding, challenge, source, or schema-field overlap.

## Self-Governance Timing

Verifiers manage their own timing. No EM broadcasts WRAP_UP.

### Three-Part Model

1. **Floor (minimum before convergence allowed)**
   - Must have fetched at least `MIN_SOURCES` sources AND worked for at least `MIN_MINUTES` minutes
   - Both conditions must be met — prevents "fast 3 sources in 2 minutes" thin convergence
   - Defaults: 5 sources, 5 minutes

2. **Diminishing Returns (between floor and ceiling)**
   - After the floor, self-assess after each source: "Did this add new verified schema field values?"
   - If last 3 consecutive sources added no new verified findings → convergence signal
   - Note in Investigation Log: "Converging: diminishing returns after source N"

3. **Ceiling (maximum research time)**
   - Configurable by the EM at team creation (default: 15 minutes)
   - Begin convergence regardless of state
   - Check time via `date +%s` in Bash, compare against spawn timestamp

### Clock Mechanism

Spawn timestamp is provided in the verifier prompt as `[SPAWN_TIMESTAMP]` (Unix epoch seconds). Verifiers check elapsed time via `date +%s` in Bash at each source-fetch cycle and compare.

## Convergence Protocol

Begin convergence when ANY of these conditions are met (AND the floor is satisfied):
- At least `MIN_SOURCES` verified sources and contradictions addressed
- Last 3 sources added no new schema field findings (diminishing returns)
- Ceiling time reached

**Steps:**
1. **Self-check acceptance criteria** — verify minimum sources met and required schema fields covered
2. **Self-check gate rules** — verify embedded quality gate rules pass (e.g., source recency, source type requirements)
3. **Self-check adversarial coverage** — "Have I challenged at least one peer's schema field value?" Note the answer.
4. Send `CONVERGING` to all peers (informational — peers should NOT reply with acknowledgments)
5. Wait ~30 seconds for final challenges
6. Answer any substantive challenges
7. Write complete output file (schema field table with change types)
8. Mark task `completed`
9. Send `DONE` to synthesizer (wake-up signal)

**Early convergence note:** Verifiers who converge early remain alive — late-arriving peer messages may warrant a quick update to findings before the agent terminates.

**Timeout:** If a CHALLENGE goes unanswered for 2 minutes → mark finding as `CONTESTED` with both sides' evidence.

### Synthesizer Output

- **Structured data:** `[OUTPUT_PATH]` (spec-defined, e.g., `tasks/research/output/FRA-intel.json`)
- **Annotations:** `{scratch-dir}/synthesis-annotations.md`
- **Advisory:** `{scratch-dir}/advisory.md` (optional — omitted if nothing beyond scope)

## Failure Handling

- **Scout fails (no discovery files):** Verifiers fall back to self-directed discovery using focus questions from scout-brief.md (full WebSearch workflow)
- **Scout times out (partial discovery files):** Verifiers use what's there + supplement with own searches for missing topics
- **Self-timed convergence (ceiling):** Verifiers begin convergence autonomously after max time, without EM intervention
- **WebSearch/WebFetch failures:** If 3 consecutive fetch attempts fail, converge with what you have and note failures in Investigation Log
- **Gate rule failure at convergence:** Note in output as `GATE_FAIL: {rule}` — verifier still completes and sends DONE; synthesizer and EM handle escalation
- **Synthesizer writes prose but no structured data file:** EM file-existence check catches this. Keep team alive, send correction message listing the expected output path and format. Re-validate on revised output.
- **All verifiers fail:** EM is notified (no completed verifier tasks), reports to PM
- **Agents stuck in idle loops:** Known platform issue — agents may enter idle loops that resist shutdown. Commit and archive results before attempting TeamDelete. If TeamDelete fails ("active" agents), wait for timeout. Do NOT block on stuck agents — read available outputs and present to PM

## Scratch Directory

`tasks/scratch/deep-research-teams/{run-id}/`

- Scout writes to: `{scratch-dir}/{subject}-scout-{topic_id}.md` (one per topic)
